have to still fill in the named routes.
"#" is the common stub URL in websites like a placeholder.
often give you options hashes so you can be flexible.
We're using bootstrap created by Twitter. container means something special for bootstrap.


<div class="center jumbotron">
  <h1>Welcome to the Sample App</h1>

  <h2>
    This is the home page for the
    <a href="http://www.railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>
    sample application.
  </h2>

  <%= link_to "Sign up now!", '#', class: "btn btn-lg btn-primary" %>
</div>

<%= link_to image_tag("rails.png", alt: "Rails logo"),
            'http://rubyonrails.org/' %>
            creates a link to an image and an alternative options hash if it doesn't load called "Rails logo"

a unique ID created by rails ensures that the image gets uploaded every time rather than having to be stored in the computer's cache. 

bootsrap also has a special meaning for btn, btn-lg and btn-primary, as well as center jumbotron

bootstrap is created in Less CSS language, but rails supports the similar Sass language so the bootstrap-sass download converts bootstrap into sass.

to link to css stylesheets, we use: touch app/assets/stylesheets/custom.css.scss
css tells us it's a css file, and scss stands for "Sassy CSS"

bundle install installs the dependancies that you've indicated in your Gemfile.

elements we tag with center will be centered

a partial is a file that connects blocks of code to an additional site, like a shim.

Asset Pipeline:
 - Asset Directories
 - Manifest Files
 - Preprocessor Engines

Asset Directories
    app/assets: assets specific to the present application
    lib/assets: assets for libraries written by your dev team
    vendor/assets: assets from third-party vendors 
Each has subdirectories.  app/assets might have /javascripts, /images, /stylesheets

Minfest Files
Tells rails how to put the parts of the files together to a single file with the sprocket gem.

manifest file for app-specific CSS: app/assets/stylesheets/application.css
 *= require_tree .
 *= require_self

Preprocessor Engines
File extensions such as .scss, .coffee and .erb tell rails what engine to run.  These are most common.
You can chain them, so that blah.js.erb.coffee would run through the coffeescript engine first, then the embedded ruby engine.

Sass CSS allows us to improve on CSS. It offers: nesting, variables and mixins.
.scss only adds features, but doesn't take away any functionality of CSS. 

Persistence:
When something doesn't have persistence, it doesn't exist after we leave the console.

Generating a controller: rails generate controller <Name> new
Generating a moedel: rails generate model <Name> new
this is the first step to creating the files within your application.
Generating also creates a migration folder which allows us to change the database incrementally.

t.timestamps is a method that creates two other timestamps called created_at and updated_at

user.save is ncessary to commit changes to the database and remain persistent
user.reload is a way to clear changes (without being saved)
user.update_attributes(name: "The Man!")  updates particular attributes of the user

by comparing hashed values instead of raw passwords, we don't have to store the passwords themselves. So our database will be more secure.

once you create a migration (like an attribute has secure password) with the rails generate command, you have to migrate the database:
bundle exec rake db:migrate
